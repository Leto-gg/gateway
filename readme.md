# proxy-gateway

This gateway integration acts as a gateway for Leto.gg to log which ipfs CID's are requested and then after cleaning the logs, they are made accessible to developers and users anonymously. This is a implementation of an IPFS Gateway that is just a set of infra built on top of the superfast Web3.Storage Gateway.
